## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to Covid-19. To accelerate the revenue post pandemic, the company has decided to come up with a mindful business plan. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. The assignment is to build a linear regression model by analysing the given dataset to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables which will also be useful to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.  
- The dataset used in this project is the 'day' dataset.
